# Annabel Unofficial Website - Angellington

This project is about a Japanese indie singer called Annabel. Her songs are captivating and very enjoyable, which inspired the creation of this project.
Maybe one day it will become **official**, or maybe not. Regardless, I really enjoyed creating this project.
